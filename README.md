# Flask match app
Match app built on Flask micro webframework. Create upcoming matches and store match results in a blog type of way. Creates JSON data of the database and prints it on https://api.tpj.fi/api/data/results or /upcoming.
# Motivation
This project was created so I wouldnt need to edit the HTML- code of www.tpj.fi everytime I wanted to update upcoming match or match results list.
